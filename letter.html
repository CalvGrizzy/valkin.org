    <p>I define myself as an enthusiastic reader and writer. Over the last two years I have read upwards of 400 books, 
        and currently have multiple worldbuilding and writing projects in the works. Before coming to ACS, I lived in Brazil 
        for 7 years, and define that as where I'm from, not the US. My handwriting is bad, so I don't enjoy writing as much on 
        paper. I may have something in my hands to work with, and I use that to help me focus. I somewhat have OCD, and
        prefer to keep everthing as close to perfects as it can be. I am a critical thinker and an active person. 
        I write audibly and think before I speak. I am not proud of my handwriting, and tried to fix it, to no avail. 
        My reading skills have outpaced my writing skills, and I may pronouce words incorrectly quite a bit. I have two 
        younger siblings, who are very annoying. My sister is a hypocrite, and my brother has never heard of a "Boundary." 
        I love programming and have a website (No dur). I have made multiple small videogames, and love the process.
