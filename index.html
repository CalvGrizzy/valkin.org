        <h1>Valkin's Webhome</h1>
        <h3>Welcome!</h3>
        <p>This is my happy little webpage where I indulge in my interests, and is a way to organize my life on the web.</p>

        <p>I will talk about my D&D campaign, my projects, my schoolwork, etc. It is also just a way to keep what I like close without having 1000 bookmarks. </p>

        <p>I use VSCode, and some html, css, and a tad bit of javascript. </p>

        <p>I started to learn to program a couple years ago with python, and have since evolved to (believe it or not) web development and game development in <a href="https://godotengine.org">Godot</a>. I am going to try to interact with the personal web as much as I can, however, it is a new area for me. </p>

        <p>This site is mainly for me, but hey, look as you please.</p>
