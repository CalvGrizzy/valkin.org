    <h1>The Story of Blobb</h1>
    <p>A simple way to see how evolution works</p>
  </header>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step 1: Blobb</h2>
    <p>Lets make a cell, and call it Blobb<br>
    Every Blobb has the genetic code telling it: “Eat 4 foods → reproduce.”</p>
    <p>The environment has less and less food, so many Blobbs die before finding enough.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step 2: Mutation</h2>
    <p>Random mutation creates a Blobb that only needs 3 food.<br>
    That small change means it reproduces sooner and leaves behind more offspring.<br>
    Over generations, more 3-food Blobbs exist than 4-food ones.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step 3: Environmental Pressure</h2>
    <p>A scientist grows Blobbs in a tank, letting them reproduce normally.<br>
    Then the environment is suddenly altered (like flushing the tank with nitrogen).<br>
    Most Blobbs die because their normal traits can’t handle nitrogen.<br>
    A few Blobbs randomly had mutations making them resistant.<br>
    Only those survivors pass their traits on, so the next generation is more nitrogen-resistant.<br>
    Repeating this process quickly “steers” evolution toward nitrogen resistance.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step 4: Blokk and BLOBB</h2>
    <p>Blobb gets attached to an altered Blobb, the altered Blobb is much larger.<br>
    Food in this new environment is rare, so Blobb struggles to reproduce.<br>
    A random mutation gives Blobb a tiny spike. It is now called Blokk<br>
    By chance, the spike pokes the host, releasing food.<br>
    Blokk with spikes reproduce more because they get more food.<br>
    Over generations, the spike trait strengthens and spreads.</p>

    <p>The larger Blobb, lets call it BLOBB gets a layer of skin<br>
    Blokk’s spike no longer works on hosts with tougher skin.<br>
    Most Blokks fail to feed and die.<br>
    A few Blokks randomly have sharper spikes that can pierce the new skin.<br>
    Those survive and reproduce, passing down the sharper spike trait.<br>
    The host may evolve even tougher skin later, restarting the cycle.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step 5: Slokk and Cooperation</h2>
    <p>One day, a simple Blobb gains a trait that allows them to detect Blokk, which will kill the Blobb, let's call them Slokk. However, they cannot defend themselves.<br>
    Eventually, they attach to a BLOBB.<br>
    The BLOBB’s normal skin cannot protect it from a Blokk, so when it feels a Blokk, it stiffens its skin, which makes it unpierceable.<br>
    However, this takes a lot of energy, so whether they do it in time is up to chance.<br>
    However, when the Slokk attaches, it evolves to send a signal to the BLOBB that tells it to stiffen its skin, and evolves to send that signal when Blokks are close.<br>
    So. They now rely on each other, and evolve into multicellular life.</p>
