    <p> The assassination of Julius Ceasar was justified, because his actions no longer benefited Rome and his assassination allowed Rome to grow.
        An example of this is in the <a href="https://www.worldbookonline.com/advanced/article?id=ar474350&st=ancient+rome#tab=homepage">article</a>, 
        where they talked about how the Republic was a better government than the Empire. The Republic allowed for more voices to be heard, and more people to have a say in the government.
        The Empire, on the other hand, was ruled by a single person, and that person could do whatever they wanted. This led to corruption and gree, which is not good for  
        the people. Ceasar was becoming more and more like an emperor, and this was not good for Rome. His assassination allowed for the Republic to be restored, and for more people to have
        a say in the government. Another example is from the article, where they said, "He had declared himself a dictator for life, [and adorned] himself with the trappings of power." 
        This quote shows how Ceasar was becoming more corrupt and greedy, and this need would not allow Rome to grow, because as a dictator, it rendered the Senate useless, and the voice of the people was gone.
        In conclusion, the assassination of Julius Ceasar was justified, because his actions no longer benefited Rome and his assassination allowed Rome to grow.
