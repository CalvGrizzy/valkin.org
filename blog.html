<dt>1. Please introduce yourself.</dt>
<dd>I'm Valkin</dd>

<dt>2. How long have you been making websites?</dt>
<dd>I made my first website in... summer of 2023? I don't exactly remember when.</dd>

<dt>3. And what got you into the hobby?</dt>
<dd>My dad, he does programming for work, and it inspired me to grow. I learned some HTML, forgot it, learned some Python, forgot it, relearned both, actually remembered this time, then moved into Game dev, and this tiny corner of the web.</dd>

<dt>4. What kind of website are you most interested in?</dt>
<dd>I love the kind of website that is just that. A website. No complications, no ads, no accounts. Just use, or someone on the webs safe space.</dd>

<dt>5. What's your workflow? Do you plan your websites out thoroughly or do you come up with the design as you go along?</dt>
<dd>Inspiration is huge. I have most of the sites that inspred me on my button wall, and I sorta just... try to do what they do. With style and structure mainly.</dd>

<dt>6. Please link to your biggest inspirations.</dt>
<dd><a href="solaria.neocities.org">Solaria</a>. This website is what go me into this whole thing. Huge inspiration, I just love the way its styled and written.</dd>

<dt>7. What's your favourite part about making websites?</dt>
<dd>The sense that I've actually made something, something that truly, really, will have a space on the web, and the space is mine.</dd>

<dt>8. And the thing you struggle with the most?</dt>
<dd>Off. I'm fine on the content, but there is just so much structure and style. Source code on websites has been a huge help, but its hard. Flexbox, display type. Its just hard.</dd>

<dt>9. Do you keep the same layout on all of your pages? Or do you use different ones?</dt>
<dd>Mainly I keep the same layout, because its easy, and I find it makes page transistions less jarring, for only the content to change. I have considered using frames for the center content, that way I can have eveything be on the same page.</dd>

<dt>10. How confident are you with CSS?</dt>
<dd>Not very confident ar all. Styling is hard, but everytime I try, I learn something new. Progress!</dd>

<dt>11. Do you know how to correctly use &lt;dl&gt;?</dt>
<dd>Oh yeah. Definitly one of my favorite elements. It makes organizing everything easy and digestible.</dd>

<dt>12. What is your favourite HTML element?</dt>
<dd>Honestly, &lt;dl&gt;, but I do love details as well. Before I had this annoyingly complex dropdown system.</dd>

<dt>13. If you're making a new web page from scratch, what is the first thing you do?</dt>
<dd>Search the internet for the base html thing. I like maing pages, but always forget how to link styles, css, and where to put DOCTYPE</dd>

<dt>14. Do you know JavaScript?</dt>
<dd>Some. I am learning some as a game framework, and could probably get better with time, but its just not what I really do. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</dd>

<dt>15. How about PHP?</dt>
<dd>Pff. Nothing at all. PHP is the kind of stuff I have never learned, nor do I ever want to interact with.</dd>

<dt>16. Does your website have a theme that you stick to?</dt>
<dd>Generally yes. I hate making different files for every page, so making files for themes themselves is just easier. I use this (honestly somewhat nasty) purple and green "hacker" style, but I have recently evolved, and love the warmer look in my most recent style.</dd>

<dt>17. Are you more focused on content or design?</dt>
<dd>Both are super important. However, content I will always somewhat prefer. I need some basic style, so barf doesn't happen, but after that, content all the way.</dd>

<dt>18. Do you own a domain name? If not, would you ever want to?</dt>
<dd>Yes. You are on it. Generally I own it because I like the fact that its <em>mine</em>, and can never be taken. It also just feels very official, which makes me feel very nice and happy.</dd>

<dt>19. What do you think of nostalgia-focused or "retro" websites?</dt>
<dd>Love them. The internet is to baby-proofed nowadays. Love corners.</dd>

<dt>20. Is your HTML valid? Do you even check?</dt>
<dd>Ummmmm. I plead the Fifth.</dd>

<dt>21. What are your opinion on buttons and banners?</dt>
<dd>They seem pretty cool. Buttons I have on my pages in my button wall are pretty cool websites, and I hope that I can help it grow. IDK what this means by banner, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.</dd>

<dt>22. What do you think of button walls in particular?</dt>
<dd>They seem pretty nice, like a screenshot of someone elses post. They are what connect us, and while they can sometimes feel cluttered, I love the organized chaos of them, not the seamless connections of the modern web.</dd>

<dt>23. If you started over again, would you make something similar or completely different?</dt>
<dd>Completely different. There are so many cool websites that approach pages not as pages, but as world in themselves, which makes them feel like a game. One day, I aspire to make something like that.</dd>

<dt>24. Are you envious of other people's websites?</dt>
<dd>Not really. I see them as inspiration, and if I was envious, I would just stew in envy, which would only make my corner of the web worse.</dd>

<dt>25. What text editor do you use?</dt>
<dd>VSCode, for built in git. Otherwise, I would just use a more simple one, with less AI.</dd>

<dt>26. Why do you use that one?</dt>
<dd>Git is hard. VSCode makes it easy.</dd>

<dt>27. Do you host your image files on your web server, or on another host?</dt>
<dd>On my web server. I can understand how some people host somewhere else, but I like my website self contained. The only exeption I have is my button wall, when peoples sites tell me that I "can just paste the code in." Love the convenience.</dd>

<dt>28. This might not be relevant to you, but what's your opinion on the Neocities vs. Nekoweb debate?</dt>
<dd>Whats Nekoweb?</dd>

<dt>29. How much server space would you estimate your main website takes up?</dt>
<dd>No more than 10 megabytes. I like things clean and messy, in a overall organized yet chaotic way. Like when your room is messy, but you know where everything is.</dd>

<dt>30. Do you keep local backups of your files?</dt>
<dd>No. Git is the way to go for me. It means on any computer, I can make changes. It has a kind of modularity to me.</dd>

<dt>31. Do you prefer simple or highly visual websites?</dt>
<dd>I love them both. Simple has its place, especially with the modern web having so much clutter with ads and buttons that barely work, but I will always take some eye candy.</dd>

<dt>32. Do you stick to certain colours? Do you do that on purpose, or is it your subconscious?</dt>
<dd>I ask my friends! My newest theme (as of the time of writing this), beige, is super nice, and I never would have thought of it if not for a friends advice.</dd>

<dt>33. Have you ever thought about quitting? Why?</dt>
<dd>Quitting what? This website? Coding? Programming? I have no job truly. I hope to get one in the future. But throughout it all, I will never, <em>never</em> quit creating with my keyboard, or my words, or my pencil. I don't need some dumb AI to do it for me.</dd>

<dt>34. Do you have many webmaster friends, or is it a solitary hobby?</dt>
<dd>Sadly no. The term webmaster is new to me, but I do not have many friend with websites. I am currently in process of convinving a friend that its worth it, and boy am I close. Ask me again in like, a week.</dd>

<dt>35. Do people in your real life know about your website?</dt>
<dd>Yes. Sadly. School is packed, so everyone in all my classes hear when I talk about it. Still, nothing I can do. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</dd>

<dt>36. Do you update your website very often? How often is "very often"?</dt>
<dd>As of recently, yes. Multiple changes per day, sometimes, during the night as well. Before... not so much. Just for a school project here and there.</dd>

<dt>37. And the overall design, do you change that much? Why or why not?</dt>
<dd>Recently, I did a whole revamp, which I am <em>loving</em> so much. It is beautiful to see my website finally grow. I had a pretty cool glitch website before, but Glitch is dead. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</dd>

<dt>38. Is your website more you-focused, hobby-focused, or outside world-focused?</dt>
<dd>Definently Me and Hobby focused. The outside world can stay outside. Here is my oasis of love in the desert of horrible news.</dd>

<dt>39. Do you do web design professionally?</dt>
<dd>No. Still in school.</dd>

<dt>40. If not, would you like to? And if you're comfortable answering, what do you do for work?</dt>
<dd>It would be pretty nice. I hope to one day work in a job that requires coding, ideally game dev, but I would also be happy as a software engineer or web developer.</dd>

<dt>41. Do you communicate with people by email very much?</dt>
<dd>No. Email is for accounts. Speaking is for... I don't really know. Social media sucks, I have no discord, and I don't want to give you my number. So... email is one of the only true options for contact.</dd>

<dt>42. Some people reject social media and use websites as a replacement. Do you keep social media outside of your website?</dt>
<dd>I despise social media. What it does to my friends and my family is not okay.</dd>

<dt>43. How about instant messengers? Do you use a mainstream one like Discord or Telegram? Or something like Matrix? Do you avoid them?</dt>
<dd>Instant messengers have there place. I have never heard of matrix, but will probobaly search it up when I'm done with this.</dd>

<dt>44. Do you listen to music while you work on websites? If so, what kinds of artists?</dt>
<dd>I work when I can. Sometimes at school, sometimes at home. I don't really listen to music at all, and may someday, but for now, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</dd>

<dt>45. Do you keep everything you make on one website, or do you have more than one?</dt>
<dd>One website is the way. Organized chaos is key. The second I make a second, there is no more chaos.</dd>

<dt>46. On a similar note, do you keep to one topic on your site, or many?</dt>
<dd><em>ALL OF THEM.</em></dd>

<dt>47. Do you present your real self, or at least try? Or do you construct a persona on purpose?</dt>
<dd>Definitly a persona, at leats the name and such, but most of the writing is genuine work on my part.</dd>

<dt>48. Have you ever made a good friend thanks to your website?</dt>
<dd>No. At least not yet. I haven't made myself enough of a frequent patron on this side of the web.</dd>

<dt>49. Are you happy with the way HTML and CSS currently work?</dt>
<dd>It has its problems, but none I can quickly name off the top of my head right here, so it must be pretty good.</dd>

<dt>50. What are practices that you think people should avoid?</dt>
<dd>I don't really what other people do. Avoid subscriptions, ads, and accounts.</dd>

<dt>51. What about under-utilised practices, or things you think people should do more?</dt>
<dd>Uhhhh. Torrenting for downloads. Its so much better.</dd>

<dt>52. Do you use a lot of semantic HTML? Or are you guilty of generic structure?</dt>
<dd>Honestly, I don't know enough about structure to consider the true meaning of this question. I use what other people use cause its the only way I know how other than W3Schools.</dd>

<dt>53. Do you consider different browsers?</dt>
<dd>Oh yeah. generally, I use the big ones, and the better ones. So instead of Safari, I would use Orion, instead of chrome, Vivaldi, and instead of firefox, Zen. The more niche ones, like keyboard based browsers, I would like to try, but haven't messed around with.</dd>

<dt>54. Speaking of, what's your preferred browser? Convince your readers why they should use it.</dt>
<dd>I use Vivaldi. Its chromium, so it supports everything, but it is also just better than chrome. It takes the bast parts of both firefox and chrome (though sadly not ublock origin). Its got great tab tiling, aboslutly amazing customization, and vertical tabs! It is just the best chromium. (In my opinion)</dd>

<dt>55. And what OS are you on?</dt>
<dd>MacOS</dd>

<dt>56. Do you have a strong opinion on that, or do you just happen to use it?</dt>
<dd>I just happen to use it. The laptop was cheap (secondhand), was light, and just worked. I prefer Linux, and would use it if it wasn't such a hassle.</dd>

<dt>57. Are your websites mobile-friendly?</dt>
<dd>hahaha. No. I honestly don't like mobile at all. It has its uses, but its just of portal of sadness in the end.</dd>

<dt>58. What are your thoughts on autoplay?</dt>
<dd>Context?</dd>

<dt>59. What are your thoughts on webrings? Are you in any?</dt>
<dd>I don't really know what they really are? I am sorta new to this, so... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</dd>

<dt>60. Do you have any web shrines? What do you like to see in that sort of page?</dt>
<dd>I personally love web shrines. I don't have one yet, but its on the list!</dd>

<dt>61. Are your websites "cliche", in your opinion?</dt>
<dd>Define cliche? Its a website, and... thats it!</dd>

<dt>62. What is your ideal website? Are you striving for that, or for something else?</dt>
<dd>As there is no such thing as an utopia, there is no such thing as an ideal website. There are great websites, some even amazing, and each has their own niche. "A website for all is a website for none." - Some wise guy</dd>

<dt>63. Are you an artist? Do you draw or design your own assets?</dt>
<dd>I do pixel art, I do web design, and I do game development. These are all arts in their own right. So yes, I consider myself an artist.</dd>

<dt>64. What are your favourite resource sites?</dt>
<dd>Uhhhhhhh. IDK. Google Image Search.</dd>

<dt>65. Is there a habit you just can't get away from no matter how hard you try?</dt>
<dd>School. I want to go home. I'm so tired.</dd>

<dt>66. What's your biggest advice for a new webmaster?</dt>
<dd>W3 Schools! It's intro is pretty great, and the How To's are super useful.</dd>

<dt>67. Do you keep all your styling in CSS? Or do you hard-code some?</dt>
<dd>CSS styling is the absolute best. It means everything is reproducable and easy to organize.</dd>

<dt>68. What do you think of frameset layouts?</dt>
<dd>I don't really use them. I hear they have problems with going back and forth, though they do sound pretty good.</dd>

<dt>69. How about table-based layouts?</dt>
<dd>Never even truly heard of them. Did some googling, made some, and they seem pretty nasty.</dd>

<dt>70. Do you subscribe to the ideas of "one-column", "two-column" and "three-column" layouts? Do you use any of these?</dt>
<dd>I have three column layout (I think) and I like how organized it is. The space and symetry makes ADHD go brrrrr.</dd>

<dt>71. Do you spend longer on the HTML or the CSS?</dt>
<dd>HTML defenitly. If the CSS works, it works. Don't fix something that isn't broken, and content feels very important to me.</dd>

<dt>72. Have you ever made a page with no CSS? It's useful for your thoughts.</dt>
<dd>Its so nasty. The default font has it's place, but not on a white page with blue links.</dd>

<dt>73. Do you ever find yourself making layouts with nothing to put on them? Or do you only make layouts when the need arises?</dt>
<dd>I truly only make layouts once or twice, and reuse and repeat. Modularity is important to me, as it is needed for gamedev, so building with bricks not walls is important to me.</dd>

<dt>74. Would you consider yourself a beginner? Or advanced? Somewhere in the middle?</dt>
<dd>Definitly in between. I know enough, yet still not much. I know like, 11 elements max, and suck at CSS.</dd>

<dt>75. Do you have a habit of looking at the source code of websites you visit?</dt>
<dd>Yes. CSS is hard. Source code is a good source of inspiration, and this community is pretty great for habits.</dd>

<dt>76. How did YOU learn how to make websites?</dt>
<dd>I learned with... 3 years of on and off HTML investigation. Made some images, forgot HTML, made some links, forgot HTML, and just kept moving forward.</dd>

<dt>77. Do you ever force elements to do things they're not supposed to?</dt>
<dd>Not really. Sometimes, I will, then realize there is a better element for my purpose.</dd>

<dt>78. Thoughts on floating elements?</dt>
<dd>No idea what they areeee.</dd>

<dt>79. When you're sizing stuff, what do you use first? Do you use px, em, %, or something else?</dt>
<dd>%, just cause I don't really know what em is, and I know it shouldn't really be pixel based.</dd>

<dt>80. Do you have a favourite font?</dt>
<dd>No. Some are nice for school, like Times New Roman, and I love high res pixel fonts.</dd>

<dt>81. Would you run a website with another person? How would that work?</dt>
<dd>Yes. Absolutely. I would if I had a friend to do it with, and it would probably work with git.</dd>

<dt>82. Do you surf the Web to find new personal websites very often?</dt>
<dd>Not really. I don't surf, I link. From personal page, to personal page, to find fun websites.</dd>

<dt>83. Do you bookmark other people's websites? How would you feel knowing someone else bookmarked yours?</dt>
<dd>No, my bookmarks are to cluttered as is, and if someone else bookmarked mine, I would be absolutely honored.</dd>

<dt>84. What do you want people to be most impressed with when they see your website?</dt>
<dd>Ummmmm. I don't really care what they think. It's my website not theirs, it's mine. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</dd>

<dt>85. Are you interested in technology outside of websites? Do you collect?</dt>
<dd>OMG Absolutely. Game dev, Arduino, Rasberry Pi, Linux, Python. I don't collect tech intentionally, (even though I do accidentaly ¯\_(ツ)_/¯) though I do love it.</dd>

<dt>86. How often and for how long are you online?</dt>
<dd>Pretty often. I have school, and it's very fancy, so we use our laptops, and I code in my free time, or read. So, a lot of time. (More then I would like)</dd>

<dt>87. When it comes to your website, who is your target audience?</dt>
<dd>Anyone who happens to care. Mainly other indie web developers, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.</dd>

<dt>88. Have you ever been interested in XHTML?</dt>
<dd>No. I barely know what it is. I read like, a 2 minute article about it then promptly forgot it.</dd>

<dt>89. Do you program in general? Have you ever written a program for use with or on your website, not counting simple JavaScript?</dt>
<dd>I do in fact program in general, as you probably know by now, but I have never made a program for my website itself.</dd>

<dt>90. Speaking of programs that help you make websites, what do you think of static site generators (SSGs)? Have you ever used one?</dt>
<dd>I used to use bloggble by ~april, but I don't anymore, prefering typing myself.</dd>

<dt>91. Do you keep a hitcounter? Why or why not?</dt>
<dd>I used to cause it seemed cool, but I don't really care anymore. Who comes or doesn't isn't up to me. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</dd>

<dt>92. Do you frequent forums? Which ones?</dt>
<dd>What the hell is a forum? I have heard of it, but have no idea what it is.</dd>

<dt>93. Do you write your page content directly into the editor, or do you prepare it elsewhere, like a text document or a Word document?</dt>
<dd>Directly in the editor. I love improv, and writing on command is just improv in disguise.</dd>

<dt>94. Do you think you appear cool to others? A more accurate answer now: do other people ever say you're cool?</dt>
<dd>Meh. I can be cool to those in school who know how cool it is to have a domain, but to everyone else ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</dd>

<dt>95. Are you embarrassed of your old work? Have you ever deleted everything out of shame?</dt>
<dd>No, just out of need for more storage.</dd>

<dt>96. Would you close down your website if you couldn't update it, or would you leave an archive?</dt>
<dd>I would never close it down. Probobaly leave an archive, or move it somewhere else, but knowledge must be mantained.</dd>

<dt>97. Do you reveal a lot about yourself on your website? Or are you more secretive?</dt>
<dd>I tell more about myself on here then I do in real life, because here, it feels anonomyous, and helps me feel free.</dd>

<dt>98. Are you willing to reveal who your best online friend is, and/or if they have a website?</dt>
<dd>Ummmm. I have an online friend who is also a real friend, but they do not have a website, and would probably not like being mentioned.</dd>

<dt>99. And do you optimise the images on your website?</dt>
<dd>No.</dd>

<dt>100. We're out of time! How do you feel after answering 100 questions? ....other than exhausted.</dt>
<dd>Very tired and happy.</dd>
